    <h1>Indus Valley Civilisation</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      The Indus Valley Civilisation[1] (IVC), also known as the Indus
      Civilisation, was a Bronze Age civilisation in the northwestern regions of
      South Asia, lasting from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE, and in its mature form 2600
      BCE to 1900 BCE.[2][a] Together with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was
      one of three early civilisations of the Near East and South Asia, and of
      the three, the most widespread, its sites spanning an area from much of
      Pakistan, to northeast Afghanistan, and northwestern India.[3][b] The
      civilisation flourished both in the alluvial plain of the Indus River,
      which flows through the length of Pakistan, and along a system of
      perennial monsoon-fed rivers that once coursed in the vicinity of the
      Ghaggar-Hakra, a seasonal river in northwest India and eastern Pakistan.
